# Rusty Toolbin

The Rusty Toolbin is a collection of convenience utilities (mostly) written in
Python. The goal of the project is to provide a place to put all those good
ideas you have time to start, but never finish. While some of these may
eventually become packages or Python modules, everything should work as a
standalone executable (at least at the moment).
